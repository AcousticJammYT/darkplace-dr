                    <p class="question">What is this?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Dark Place is a open-source Deltarune fangame made in the Kristal Engine. It's roughly inspired by the r/place event that's held on Reddit during April Fools Day, both in concept as well as in namesake.</p>
                    <p class="question">Can I help out on this mod?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Of course! The project is open-source, so anyone is free to contribute to this mod. If you aren't really familiar with how the Kristal engine works, then there's definitely some other ways you can contribute to it. Whether it be through art, music, etc.</p>
                    <p class="question">Is there a story?</p>
                    <p class="answer">
                      There isn't much, but Dark Place has a fairly simple story.<br> 
                      <br>
                      In this game, it turns out that Ralsei was wrong about the Roaring bringing the end of the world (as was stated in DELTARUNE Chapter 2) and it's completely fine to make a bunch of Dark Fountains everywhere.<br>
                      <br>
                      Only side-effect though is that the more that are made, the weirder the Dark Worlds spawned from them get.<br>
                      <br>
                      Susie, one of Deltarune's main characters, just so happens to be on her 1000th fountain during the events of Dark Place, and this one is one of the weirdest ones yet.<br>
                      <br>
                      Upon entering, Susie ends up being split up from Kris and the rest of the Fun Gang. So now it's up to her and her newfound companion, YOU the Frog (of Ribbit fame), to explore the strange world she created and find her friends.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p class="question">How did Dark Place get its name?</p>
                    <p class="answer">
                      Dark Place's name was created by AcousticJamm.<br> 
                      <br>
                      The original name was "Open Kristal Mod", but that sucked ass, so Brenda decided to take more suggestions.<br>
                      <br>
                      Jamm suggested "Dark Place" as a joke about r/place, but the others involved liked it for whatever reason, so it kinda stuck.</p>
                      <br>

                        <p class="issue">Flowey appears when I boot up the mod and sends me to the Dogcheck screen. What do I do?</p>
                        <p class="resolve">
                          Most likely case scenario is that you were trying to play the mod on an older version of the Kristal engine.<br>
                          <br>
                          Since Dark Place is constantly changing, you'll either need the latest version or source code of the engine to play the mod.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="trouble">
                        <p class="issue">The mod crashes when I start it up.</p>
                        <p class="resolve">
                          That probably means someone did a oopsie in the mod's code.<br>
                          Usually though, errors like these tend to be fixed relatively quickly, so this shouldn't become too much a big issue.</p>
