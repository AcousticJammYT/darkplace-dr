                    <p class="question">What is this?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Dark Place is a open-source Deltarune fangame made in the Kristal Engine. It's roughly inspired by the r/place event that's held on Reddit during April Fools Day, both in concept as well as in namesake.</p>
                    <p class="question">Can I help out on this mod?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Of course! The project is open-source, so anyone is free to contribute to this mod. If you aren't really familiar with how the Kristal engine works, then there's definitely some other ways you can contribute to it. Whether it be through art, music, etc.</p>
                    <p class="question">Is there a story?</p>
                    <p class="answer">
                      There isn't much, but Dark Place has a fairly simple story. 
                      <br>
                      In this game, it turns out that Ralsei was wrong about the Roaring bringing the end of the world (as was stated in DELTARUNE Chapter 2) and it's completely fine to make a bunch of Dark Fountains everywhere.
                      <br>
                      Only side-effect though is that the more that are made, the weirder they get.
                    </p>
                    <p class="question">How did Dark Place get its name?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Dark Place's name was created by AcousticJamm. The original name was "Open Kristal Mod", but that sucked ass, so Brenda decided to take more suggestions. Jamm suggested "Dark Place" as a joke about r/place, but the others involved liked it for whatever reason, so it kinda stuck.</p>
